My name is Andrew Finfrock, I'm from Eastern Iowa.
I'm very interested in learning more programming skills as it is a incredibly useful skill in a engineering career or cool personal projects.
I personally don't have any private progamming projects but I'd like to start some in the future.

My favorite hobby is painting miniatures mostly from the game Warhammer 40,000 but I have more models than I probably should.
